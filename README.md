# Vigenère Cipher Python Project

This Python project implements the Vigenère Cipher, a classic encryption technique that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt messages. The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, meaning it uses multiple substitution alphabets to encrypt the message.

## Features

- Encryption of plaintext using a keyword and the Vigenère Cipher algorithm
- Decryption of ciphertext using the same keyword and algorithm
- Support for both uppercase and lowercase letters
- User-friendly interface for inputting the plaintext, keyword, and choosing between encryption and decryption modes
